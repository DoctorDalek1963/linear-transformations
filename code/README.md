# LinTrans

This is the Python library that I'm creating to visualise 2D linear transformations for my A Level Computer Science NEA.

The actual `lintrans` package can be found in `src/`.

The basic structure of this project was taken from [this mCoding YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhUpxWjOhME) and its associated [GitHub repositiory](https://github.com/mCodingLLC/SlapThatLikeButton-TestingStarterProject).
