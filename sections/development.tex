Please note, throughout this section, every code snippet will have two comments at the top. The first is the git commit hash that the snippet was taken from\footnote{A history of all commits can be found in the GitHub repository\cite{lintrans-github}}. The second comment is the file name. The line numbers of the snippet reflect the line numbers of the file from where the snippet was taken. After a certain point, I introduced copyright comments at the top of every file. These are always omitted here.
