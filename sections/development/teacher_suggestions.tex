Now that I've got \texttt{v0.2.2} working and released, it's time to talk to some teachers. Ms Arnold is going to be the one that's actually using it, so obviously I needed to talk to her about it, but she wasn't available for a few days. I was talking to another maths teacher, Mr Dunkley, about my personal statement and took the opportunity to show him \texttt{lintrans} as well.

He was able to download and run it on a native Windows 10 installation, which was quite a relief. I'd been unable to test it on a real bare-metal Windows installation so far; I only had virtual machines.

He suggested two main improvements: \begin{enumerate}
	\item In the visual definition dialog, the basis vectors should snap to integer coordinates when they get close enough
	\item There should be a dialog box which displays matrices that you've already defined
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Fixing a bug with animating stretches\label{development:teacher-suggestions:fixing-a-bug-with-animating-stretches}}

While Mr Dunkley was playing around with \texttt{lintrans}, I noticed a bug where animating uniform stretches, where every direction gets stretched equally work, just fine, but a matrix like $\begin{pmatrix}3 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$ would be animated as if it was $\begin{pmatrix}3 & 0\\ 0 & 3\end{pmatrix}$ and the plane would stretch equally in all directions.

After looking at the code later, I realised this was a problem with my new animation code detecting this type of matrix as a rotation. To fix this, I could just add a check to the \texttt{if} statement before the rotation animation code. This new check would make sure that the basis vectors of the application matrix were approximately the same length. By checking this as well, I fixed the bug.
