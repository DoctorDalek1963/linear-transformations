\subsubsection{Hiding the background and transformed grids\label{development:making-v0.2.2:hiding-the-background-and-transformed-grids}}

I spoke to my main stakeholder, who is the teacher that will be using \texttt{lintrans} when it's finished, and she said that the background grid and transformed grid can get a little bit in the way of the core action and make it harder to understand what's happening. Taking this feedback on board, I decided to add a display setting to toggle the background grid, and one to toggle the transformed grid.

I did the background grid first and then repeated everything for the transformed version of the grid as well. I am combining them here for brevity. The first step was of course to add a display setting for each of them. Then I had to add checkboxes for them in the display settings dialog, and then incorporate the settings into the actual drawing of the canvas.
