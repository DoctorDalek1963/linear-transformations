One of the topics in the A Level Further Maths course is linear transformations, as represented by matrices. This is a topic all about how vectors move and get transformed in the plane. It's a topic that lends itself exceedingly well to visualization, but students often find it hard to visualize this themselves, and there is a considerable lack of good tools to provide visual intuition on the subject. There is the YouTube series \textit{Essence of Linear Algebra} by 3blue1brown\cite{essence-of-linear-algebra}, which is very good, but I couldn't find any good interactive visualizations.

My solution is to develop a desktop application that will allow the user to define 2x2 matrices and view these matrices and compositions thereof as linear transformations of a 2D plane. This will give students a way to get to grips with linear transformations in a more hands-on way, and will give teachers the ability to easily and visually show concepts like determinants and invariant lines.
