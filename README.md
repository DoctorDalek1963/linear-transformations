# lintrans website

This `gh-pages` branch just contains the website for the project, viewable [here](https://doctordalek1963.github.io/lintrans).
This branch is mostly automated with GitHub actions compiling and pushing the docs and write-up PDF here.
But this branch will also contain a tutorial on using the `lintrans` program when it's ready to be released.
