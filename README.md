This is my GitHub repository for my A Level Computer Science NEA (Non-Exam Assessment).

The source code of the project is written in Python and is in the root of the repo. The write-up for the project is written in LaTeX and can be found in `write_up/`.

The actual `lintrans` Python package can be found in `src/`.

The basic structure of this project was taken from [this mCoding YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhUpxWjOhME) and its associated [GitHub repositiory](https://github.com/mCodingLLC/SlapThatLikeButton-TestingStarterProject).
