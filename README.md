## NOTICE
This project is still a work in progress and is not even in a usable state yet. It is actively being worked on.

---

This is the `lintrans` Python package, with included GUI. This project aims to provide an easy way to
visualize matrices as linear transformations. The user can define 2x2 matrices and visualize them in 2D
space. The user can also visualize compositions of defined matrices - addition and multiplication - as well
as inverses and transpositions.

This program is aimed at teachers teaching linear transformations, as well as students learning it for the
first time. The 3blue1brown series [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
is a fantastic learning resource for this topic and I aim to provide an interactive supplement to that series.

The Python source code can be found in `src/` and the full documentation can be found on [my GitHub pages site](https://doctordalek1963.github.io/lintrans/).

This project is also my A Level Computer Science NEA (Non-Exam Assessment), which means I need to provide a
write-up of the development process. This write-up is written in LaTeX and can be found in `write-up/`.

## Usage

Currently, this project is nowhere near feature complete. Transformations can't even be visualized yet.

Don't use it yet.

on GitHub or email me at [dyson.dyson@icloud.com](mailto:dyson.dyson@icloud.com) if you don't have a GitHub account.

Open source contributions are sadly not open at this time, because this is a school project, which means I need
to do it on my own. If you want to contribute to this project and make it better in the future, just email me
and I'll notify you when I can open the project to other contributors.
