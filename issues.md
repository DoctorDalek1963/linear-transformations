* transitional animation with commas won't reset when the target matrix is the same
- right click to delete point of polygon is hard with trackpad (better UI or better signposting?)
- better zoom indication and use (scrolling is hard on trackpad)
- pan around (definitely when defining a polygon; possibly elsewhere as well)
* adjust scroll sensitivity in global settings
