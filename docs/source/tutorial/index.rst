Tutorial
========

This tutorial will guide you through using lintrans for teaching, or to aid in your own learning.

If you don't already have lintrans downloaded, please `download the latest version
<https://github.com/DoctorDalek1963/lintrans/releases/latest>`_ and make sure you're reading the
latest version of this tutorial.

You can get back to this tutorial at any point by clicking ``Help`` along the top of the app, and
then ``Tutorial``, or by pressing ``F1`` on your keyboard.

There are several sections and I would highly recommend reading them in order.
