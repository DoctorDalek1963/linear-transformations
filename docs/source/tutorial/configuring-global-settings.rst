Configuring global settings
===========================

lintrans has a few global settings which persist between sessions. These settings include things
like the size of the draggable circle around vector tips, as well as whether to snap vectors to
integer coordinates when dragging them.

When you go to ``File`` > ``Settings``, you will be presented with this menu:

   :align: center

If you hover over any of the options, you'll get a tooltip explaining what the option does. If you
click the `Reset to defaults` button, then it will reset the settings back to these defaults.

Distances
---------

When using lintrans on a laptop, for example, it can be difficult to be precise with the trackpad.
These settings allow you to edit the distances needed to drag vectors, or snap them to integer
coordinates.

Updating
--------

lintrans supports the ability to be installed on Windows and Linux. When installed as a proper
application using the appropriate installer, lintrans can automatically update itself in the
background when it detects a new version is available.

The way in which it updates itself can be configured here. It can be silent and automatic, prompt
you whenever an update is detected, or it can never update itself.
