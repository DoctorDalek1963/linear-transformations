Reporting bugs and suggesting features
======================================

I always want to make lintrans as good as it can be. So if you discover a bug, please report it.
Likewise, if you think lintrans is missing something, or you've got an idea to improve it, please
suggest a new feature.

These can both be done by going to ``Help`` > ``Give feedback`` in the app itself, or you can
`report a bug <https://forms.gle/Q82cLTtgPLcV4xQD6>`_ or `suggest a
feature <https://forms.gle/mVWbHiMBw9Zq5Ze37>`_ from here.

Those links go to Google Forms, which can be filled out by anyone. If you have a GitHub account,
please use it to report your bug or suggest your feature directly on GitHub. The links are on the
Google Forms. Using your own account makes it much easier to communicate with you and get more
details about the problem. You can include your email address in the anonymous form if you don't
have a GitHub account but are still happy to be contacted about your problem.
