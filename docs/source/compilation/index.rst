How to compile lintrans (vVERSION_NUMBER)
=========================================

This is a tutorial on how to compile lintrans from its source code. This is necessary on some
operating systems, but available for all of them. If you're on Windows, it's easier to just
download the exe from the `release page
<https://github.com/DoctorDalek1963/lintrans/releases/tag/vVERSION_NUMBER>`_.

.. note::

   All the links and examples in this tutorial assume you're using lintrans version |version| but
   this may not be the current latest version.

   If there is a note at the top of this page that says this is not the latest version of the
   documentation, please use the latest version instead.

The process of compilation is generally the same on all platforms, but there are three versions of
this tutorial available for the three major operating systems.
