How to compile lintrans
=======================

This is a tutorial on how to compile lintrans from its source code. This is necessary on some
operating systems, but available for all of them. If you're on Windows, it's easier to just
download the exe from the `release page <https://github.com/DoctorDalek1963/lintrans/releases/latest>`_.

The process of compilation is generally the same on all platforms, but there are three versions of
this tutorial available for the three major operating systems.
