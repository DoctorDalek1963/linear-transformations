Welcome to the lintrans documentation
=====================================

This is the documentation for lintrans version |release|. It is split into 2 parts.

The first part is the :ref:`tutorial<tutorial>`, which explains how to use the software.
If you just want to use it for teaching or learning linear transformations, read this.

The second part is the :ref:`backend documentation<backend>`. This is only relevant
if you are a maintainer of the software (currently just me) or want to learn about
its inner workings. The backend documentation is very technical, and you don't need
to read it to learn how to use the software.
