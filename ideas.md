- 2d plane with original grid and transformed grid
- options for plane, like checkboxes to draw each grid
- dragable i and j basis vectors
- 26 matrices can be defined and stored with names A-Z
- can be defined as standard matrices of numbers, or by dragging the basis vectors in a separate definition dialog
- user can view one transformation by dragging, or they can view one as the composition of defined matrices
- there will be a text box below the visualisation grid, where the user can specify the expression of the transformation
- they can add and multiply defined matrices, and apply things like powers, taking inverses, and transpositions
- matrices can also be multiplied by the determinants of matrices
- a `rot()` function will be available to do easy rotation matrices
- matrices can be defined in terms of variables, which can be adjusted live with sliders
- the determinant of the final transformation can be visualised as parallelogram area
- unit circle drawn on original grid, and then transformed
- invariant lines can be drawn when they exist (when do the exist?)
- transformations can be animated, applying each matrix right to left in turn
- polygons on the original grid can be defined as a list of points, and their transformation can be viewed
